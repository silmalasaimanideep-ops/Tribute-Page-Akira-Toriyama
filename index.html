          <p><strong>Akira Toriyama</strong> was born on <time datetime="1955-04-05">April 5, 1955</time> in Nagoya,
            Japan. His early success began with <em>Dr. Slump</em>, followed by the creation of <em>Dragon Ball</em> in
            1984, which became one of the best-selling manga series in history.</p>

          <p>Toriyama first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the manga series Dr. Slump, for which he earned
            the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen/shōjo. Dr. Slump went on to sell over 35 million copies in
            Japan. It was adapted into an anime, with a second series created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended.

            From 1984 to 1995 he wrote and illustrated the Dragon Ball manga, serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump. It
            became one of the best-selling manga series of all time, with 260 million copies sold worldwide,[1][a][c]
            and is considered a key work in increasing manga circulation to its peak in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s.
            Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and similarly boosted
            anime's general popularity.

            Beside his manga works, Toriyama acted as a character designer for several video games such as the Dragon
            Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon.</p>

          <p><strong>Dragon Ball</strong> expanded into anime, films, and games, influencing manga artists worldwide.
            Toriyama also designed characters for <em>Dragon Quest</em> and multiple multimedia projects.</p>

          <P>After quitting his job at the age of 23 and asking his mother for money while unemployed, Toriyama entered
            the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, which he
            had randomly picked up in a coffee shop.[11][15] The timing did not line up for that contest, but another
            manga magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump, accepted submissions for their Newcomer Award every month. Kazuhiko
            Torishima, who would become his editor, read and enjoyed Toriyama's manga, but it was not eligible to
            compete because it was a parody of Star Wars instead of an original work. Torishima sent the artist a
            telegram and encouraged him to keep drawing and sending him manga.[15][16] This resulted in Wonder Island,
            which became Toriyama's first published work when it appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1978. It finished
            last place in the readers survey.[11][15] Toriyama later said that he had planned to quit manga after
            getting paid, but because Wonder Island 2 (1978) was also a "flop", his stubbornness would not let him and
            he continued to draw failed stories for a year; claiming around 500 pages' worth, including the published
            Today's Highlight Island (1979).[11] He said he learned a lot during this year and even had some fun. When
            Torishima told him to draw a female lead character, Toriyama hesitantly created 1979's Tomato the Cutesy
            Gumshoe, which had some success. Feeling encouraged, he decided to draw another female lead and created Dr.
            Slump.[11]</P>
